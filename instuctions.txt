St*rbucks Egg Bites At Home

INGREDIENTS:
18 eggs
1 cup cottage cheese (full fat)
1 cup shredded cheese of choice
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp salt
Added ingredients of choice: bacon, tomato, chives, spinach, etc.

DIRECTIONS:
1. Preheat the oven to 300F and place a brownie tray with water into the oven. This will create a more humid environment. Grease a muffin tin.
2. Add the eggs, cottage cheese, shredded cheese, and seasoning to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth. Be careful here not to over-blend and incorporate too much air, as this can cause the egg bites to deflate.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the muffin cups. For best results use a silicon muffin tin. Fill up each cup about half way. If you want to add in bacon or any veg, do that now!
4. Place the muffin tin in the oven for around 35-37 minutes. You want them to be totally set.
5. Remove from oven and enjoy!
